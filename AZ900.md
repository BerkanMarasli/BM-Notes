### Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features

#### Describe core Azure identity services

- Explain the difference between **authentication and authorisation**.
- Define **Azure Active Directory**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Active Directory**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **Conditional Access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

AuthN and AuthZ: authentication (AuthN) is the process of proving that you are who you say you are. Authorisation (AuthZ) is the act of granting an authetnicated party permission to do something.

Azure Active Directory (AD): is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service which helps your employees sign in and access resources: internal resources such as apps on your corporate network or custom cloud apps; **external resources** such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and many SaaS apps.

Single Sign-On (SSO): means a user doesn't have to sign into every application they use. The user logs in **once** and that credential is used for **multiple** apps. Single sign-on based authentication systems are often called "**modern authentication**".

MFA: Azure AD MFA works by requiring two or more of the following authentication methods: something you **know** (pin or password); something you **have** (trusted device); something you **are** (biometric).

Conditional Access: used by Azure AD to bring signals together, to make descisions, and enforce organisational policies. Signals can be user and location, device, application, real-time risk.

#### Describe Azure governance features

- Describe the functionality and usage of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **resource locks**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **tags**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Policy**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Blueprints**.
- Describt the **Cloud Adoption Framework** for Azure.

RBAC: helps you manage **who** has access to Azure resources, **what** they can do with those resources, and **which** resources/areas they access to. Built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained **access management** of Azure resources.

Resource Locks: prevent other users in your organisation from accidentally **deleting or modifying** critical resources. The lock **overrides any permissions** the user might have.

Policy: the **definition of the conditions** which you want to control/govern.

Initiative: a **collection of Azure policy definitions** that are grouped together towards a specific goal.

Blueprint: a container for composing **sets of standards, patterns, and requirements** for implementation of Azure cloud services, security and design. Often used in the same setence as the phrase "new environments".

Tags: a name and a value pair used to logically organise Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions into a logical taxonomy. Tags can be the basis for **applying business policies or tracking costs**. You can also **enforce tagging rules** with Azure policies.

Cloud Adoption Framework: guidance designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies to succeed in Azure.

#### Describe privacy and compliance resources

- Describe the Microsoft core tenets of **Security, Privacy, and Compliance**.
- Describe the purpose of the **Microsoft Privacy Statement, Online Services Terms (OST) and Data Protection Amendment (DPA)**.
- Describe the purpose of the **Trust Center**.
- Describt the purpose of the **Azure compliance documentation**.
- Describe the purpose of **Azure Soverign Regions (Azure Government cloud services and Azure China cloud services)**.

Security: protecting the data that's entrusted to Microsoft by using strong encryption and access controls.

Privacy: is about making meaningful choices for **how** and **why** data is collected and used.

Compliance: with regulations is critical, and Microsoft aims to ease this task for Azure customers.

Azure Compliance Documentation: to make it easier to find, compliance documentation is **grouped geographically, and by industry**. You'll also find **template audit documents** that you can tailor to your or your customers needs. 

Microsoft Privacy Statement: explains **what** data Microsoft processes, **how** Microsoft processes it, and **for what** purpose the data is ultilised.

Online Service Terms (OST): contains all the terms and conditions for software and online services through Microsoft **Commercial Licensing** programs. OST has been renamed/re-purposed to Product Terms site.

Data Protection Amendment (DPA): further defines the data processing and security terms for online services, including compliance, disclosure, security, transfer, and retention. DPA is actually Data Protection Addendum.

Trust Center: where you can learn about the **four foundational principles of trust: security, privacy, compliance, and transparency.**

Azure Soverign Regions: special regions that you might need for compliance or legal purposes: **Government, China, Germany**. They are **operated by special trustees**. There is **physical and logical isolation**.

### Describe Azure cost management and Service Level Agreements

#### Describe methods for planning and managing costs

- Identify factors that can **affect costs** (resource types, services, locations, ingress, and egress traffic).
- Identify factors that can **reduce costs** (reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing).
- Describe the functionality and usage of the **Pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator**.
- Describe the functionality and usage of **Azure Cost Management**.

Cost impacts: factors that can affect Azure resource costs include resource **types, services, locations, ingress, and egress traffic**.

Reducing costs: factors that can reduce costs include **reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing**.

- Reserved instances: reserve **virtual machines** in advance and save up to 72% compared to PAYG pricing with 1-year or 3-year commitment.
- Reserved capacity: achieve significant savings on **Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Cache for Redis**. Discount is product-specific. Enables you to more easily manage costs across **predictable** and **variable** workloads and help optimise budgeting and forecasting - also includes 1-year and 3-year options.
- Hybrid use benefit: a **licensing benefit** that helps you to signifcantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud. Lets you use your **on-premises Software Assurance-enabled** Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. Windows Server, SQL Server, Redhat, and Use Linux.
- Spot pricing: access **unused Azure compute capacity** at deep discounts - up to 90% compared to PAYG prices. Applies to Azure Virtual Machines only.

Pricing Calculator: interactive calculator that allows you to estimate Azure resource costs **before you deploy**. Enables you to choose **region, instance, tiers**, etc to match functionality and budget needs.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator: estimate the cost savings you can realise by **migrating your workloads** to Azure (**and before deploying**).

Azure Cost Management: a suite of tools provided by Microsoft that hekps you **analyse, manage, and optimise the costs** of your workloads **after you deploy**.

#### Describe Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and service lifecycles

- Describe the purpose of an **Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA)**.
- Identify actions that can impact an **SLA** (i.e. Availability Zones).
- Describe the **service lifecycle** in Azure (Public Preview and General Availability).

Purpose of Azure SLAs: to provide a clear explanation of availability (and sometimes performance) of an Azure service.

Actions that can affect an SLA: failing to deploy a service in a manner that meets the SLA requirements.

Service lifecyle: **private preview (open only to companies or users invited - for evaluation only), public preview (open to public, but preview limitations apply - not running in production), general availability (GA) - ready for production.**
