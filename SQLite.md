##Â Query

### `SELECT`

To retrieve data from a SQL database

```sqlite
-- Select query for all columns with all rows
SELECT * FROM mytable;

-- Select query for specific columns with all rows
SELECT column, another_column, ... FROM mytable;
```



### `WHERE`

To filter rows

Applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the result or not

```sqlite
-- Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, ... FROM mytable WHERE condition AND/OR another_condition AND/OR ...;
```

For numerical data:
