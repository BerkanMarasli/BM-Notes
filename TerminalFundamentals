MacOS Terminal (zsh [z shell])

pwd = print working directory // prints the path of the current directory
ls = list items // lists all items (folders, docs, etc) in the current directory

cd [] = change directory // use to change directory
    / use to navigate to root directory
    /Users use to navigate to users directory (absolute path)
    ~ use to navigate to home directory
    (foldername/foldername/etc) use to navigate to a specific folder in directory (relative path)
    .. use to go back one hierarchy level

touch [] = create file // creates new file in the current directory
    filename with extension (ABC.html, ABC.js, etc)
    multiple files can be created by adding filename with extension back to back with space
    /ZZ/ABC.html will create the file inside ZZ directory

mkdir [] = create directory // creates new folder in the current directory
    foldername with no extension
    /ZZ/foldername will create a folder inside ZZ directory
    TO HAVE A SPACE IN THE NAME use \ (with\ spaces = with spaces) - same logic applies for everything else

rm [] = remove file // removes file from the current directory
    filename with extension (ABC.html, ABC.js, etc)
    can be done for multiple files via filenames with spaces in between

rmdir [] = remove directory // removes folder in the current directory
    multple works, \ for folders with spaces, no extension in name
    cannot remove directory if not empty (can use rm -r)

man [command] = manual // access manual of command with 'flags' (additional options)
    use 'q' to go back to main shell

cp [] = copy // copy files 
    fileToCopy directoryToCopyTo (webdev/index.html ./)
    ./ means current directory
    TO COPY FOLDER: for example, cp -r foldername ~

mv [] = move // move files
    for example, mv ../webdev webdev/
    no flag needed for folders
    TO RENAME FILES: for example, mv index.html index2.html
